# CEG-3120: Project 4

## Setup:

- [x] Create public repo per link in Pilot
- [x] Clone repo to your working environment (you should not need to use EC2 instances).
- [x] Install [Docker for Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
  - [x] installed through the arch repository (double check that this is the correct version)
  - [x] docker is disabled by default needed to run `sudo systemctl enable docker` and then `sudo systemctl start docker`
  - [x] check status `systemctl status docker`
  - [x] added my user to docker group with the following commands:
    - [x] `getent group docker` shows the docker group and group ID
    - [x] `whoami` double check my user name
    - [x] `sudo gpasswd -a dayne docker` added user to docker group
- ~~[ ] Maybe: Install [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)~~

## Part 2: Milestone due 4/16

- Set up with AWS CodeBuild, have return status be used of whether of not Dockerfile could be built.
- TODO: Add milestone deliverables

## Part 3: Milestone due 4/23

- If success, get AWS AMI credentials (GitHub Secrets), upload container to ECR
- Update ECS to use new container
- TODO: Add milestone deliverables

## Extra Credit:

- Dockerize your python bot
  - Will require use of GitHub Secrets to protect the API key
  - This guide has a parallel example with some things to consider
