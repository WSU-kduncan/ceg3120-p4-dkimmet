# CEG-3120: Project 4

## Setup:

- [x] Create public repo per link in Pilot
- [x] Clone repo to your working environment (you should not need to use EC2 instances).
- [x] Install [Docker for Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
  - [x] installed through the arch repository (double check that this is the correct version)
  - [x] docker is disabled by default needed to run `sudo systemctl enable docker` and then `sudo systemctl start docker`
  - [x] check status `systemctl status docker`
  - [x] added my user to docker group with the following commands:
    - [x] `getent group docker` shows the docker group and group ID
    - [x] `whoami` double check my user name
    - [x] `sudo gpasswd -a dayne docker` added user to docker group
- ~~[ ] Maybe: Install [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)~~

## Extra Credit:
